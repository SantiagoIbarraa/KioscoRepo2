  # Fix RLS Policies for Demo Authentication

  1. Simplify RLS policies to work with demo authentication
  2. Add fallback policies for easier development
  3. Temporarily disable strict RLS for products table to allow demo functionality

  This migration addresses the authentication mismatch between demo users and Supabase RLS.

-- Temporarily disable RLS on products table for demo purposes
ALTER TABLE products DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Re-enable RLS but with simplified policies
ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Everyone can read available products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Kiosquero and admin can read all products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Kiosquero and admin can manage products" ON products;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Kiosquero and admin can insert products" ON products;

-- Create simplified policies that work with demo authentication
CREATE POLICY "Allow read access to products"
  ON products
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow insert for authenticated users"
  ON products
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow update for authenticated users"
  ON products
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Allow delete for authenticated users"
  ON products
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Also simplify orders policies for demo
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own orders" ON orders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create own orders" ON orders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Kiosquero and admin can read all orders" ON orders;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Kiosquero and admin can update orders" ON orders;

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on orders"
  ON orders
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Simplify order_items policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own order items" ON order_items;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create order items for own orders" ON order_items;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Kiosquero and admin can read all order items" ON order_items;

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on order_items"
  ON order_items
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Note: In production, you would want to restore proper RLS policies
-- This is a temporary fix for demo purposes
